## Configuration

In your next.config.js file, ensure you have the following configuration:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: false,
};

export default nextConfig;
```

#### Explanation

This configuration ensures that the Svelte web components render correctly. The swcMinify: false setting is crucial because Svelte web components and their rendering nature can sometimes conflict with aggressive minification processes. Disabling SWC minification helps prevent potential issues with web component rendering.
